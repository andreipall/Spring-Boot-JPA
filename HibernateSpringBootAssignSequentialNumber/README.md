**Description:** This application is an example of assigning a database temporary sequence of values to rows via the window function, `ROW_NUMBER()`. This window function is available in almost all databases, and starting with version 8.x is available in MySQL as well.

**Key points:**
- commonly, you don't need to fetch in the result set the temporary sequence of values produced by `ROW_NUMBER()` (you will use it internally, in the query, usually in the `WHERE` clause and CTEs), but, this time, let's write a Spring projection (DTO) that contains a getter for the column generated by `ROW_NUMBER`as well
- write several native querys relying on `ROW_NUMBER()` window function
