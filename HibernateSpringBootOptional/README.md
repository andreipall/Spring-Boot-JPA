**[Use Java 8 `Optional` In Entities And Queries](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootOptional)**
 
**Description:** This application is an example of how is correct to use the Java 8 `Optional` in entities and queries. 

**Key points:**
- use the Spring Data built-in query-methods that return `Optional` (e.g., `findById()`)
- write your own queries that return `Optional`
- use `Optional` in entities getters
- in order to run different scenarios check the file, `data-mysql.sql`
