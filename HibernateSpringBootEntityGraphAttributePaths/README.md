**[How To Define Ad-Hoc Entity Graphs In Spring Boot](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootEntityGraphAttributePaths)**

**Note:** In a nutshell, *entity graphs* (aka, *fetch plans*) is a feature introduced in JPA 2.1 that help us to improve the performance of loading entities. Mainly, we specify the entityâ€™s related associations and basic fields that should be loaded in a single `SELECT` statement. We can define multiple *entity graphs* for the same entity and *chain* any number of entities and even use *sub-graphs* to create complex *fetch plans*. To override the current `FetchType` semantics there are properties that can be set:

*Fetch Graph* (default), `javax.persistence.fetchgraph`\
The attributes present in `attributeNodes` are treated as `FetchType.EAGER`. The remaining attributes are treated as `FetchType.LAZY` regardless of the default/explicit `FetchType`.

*Load Graph*, `javax.persistence.loadgraph`\
The attributes present in `attributeNodes` are treated as `FetchType.EAGER`. The remaining attributes are treated according to their specified or default `FetchType`.

**Nevertheless, the JPA specs doesn't apply in Hibernate for the basic (`@Basic`) attributes.**. More details [here](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootNamedEntityGraphBasicAttrs).

**Description:** This is a sample application of defining ad-hoc *entity graphs* in Spring Boot.

**Key points:**
- define two entities, `Author` and `Book`, involved in a lazy bidirectional `@OneToMany` relationship
- the *entity graph* should load in a single `SELECT` the authors and the associatated books
- in `AuthorRepository` rely on Spring `@EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"books"})` annotation to indicate the ad-hoc *entity graph*
