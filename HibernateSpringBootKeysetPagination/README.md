**[How To Implement Keyset Pagination in Spring Boot](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootKeysetPagination)**

**Description:** When we rely on an *offset* paging we have the performance penalty induced by throwing away *n* records before reached the desired *offset*. Larger *n* leads to a significant performance penalty. When we have a large *n* is better to rely on *keyset* pagination which maintain a "constant" time for large datasets. In order to understand how bad *offset* can perform please check this [article](http://allyouneedisbackend.com/blog/2017/09/24/the-sql-i-love-part-1-scanning-large-table/):

**Need to know if there are more records?**\
By its nature, *keyset* doesn't use a `SELECT COUNT` to fetch the number of total records. But, with a little tweak, we can easily say if there are more records, therefore to show a button of type `Next Page`. Mainly, if you need such a thing then consider [this application](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootKeysetPaginationNextPage). 

**Key points:**
- choose the column(s) to act as the latest visited record (e.g., `id`)
- use the column(s) in the `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses of your SQL
