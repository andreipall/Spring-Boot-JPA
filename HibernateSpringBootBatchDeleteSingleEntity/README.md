**Description:** Batch deletes that don't involve associations in MySQL.

**Note:** Spring `deleteAllInBatch()` and `deleteInBatch()` don't use delete batching and don't take advantage of automatic optimstic locking mechanism to prevent *lost updates* (e.g., `@Version` is ignored). They rely on `Query.executeUpdate()` to trigger *bulk* operations. These operations are fast, but Hibernate doesnâ€™t know which entities are removed, therefore, the Persistence Context is not updated accordingly (it's up to you to flush (before delete) and close/clear (after delete) the Persistence Context accordingly to avoid issues created by unflushed (if any) or outdated (if any) entities). The first one (`deleteAllInBatch()`) simply triggers a `delete from entity_name` statement and is very useful for deleting all records. The second one (`deleteInBatch()`) triggers a `delete from entity_name where id=? or id=? or id=? ...` statement, therefore, is prone to cause issues if the generated `DELETE` statement exceedes the maximum accepted size. This issue can be controlled by deleting the data in chunks, relying on `IN` operator, and so on. *Bulk* operations are faster than batching which can be achieved via the `deleteAll()`, `deleteAll(Iterable<? extends T> entities)` or `delete()` method. Behind the scene, the two flavors of `deleteAll()` relies on `delete()`. The `delete()`/`deleteAll()` methods rely on `EntityManager.remove()` therefore the Persistence Context is synchronized accordingly. Moreover, if automatic optimstic locking mechanism (to prevent *lost updates*) is enabled then it will be used.

**Key points for *regular* delete batching:**
- for deleting in batches rely on `deleteAll()`, `deleteAll(Iterable<? extends T> entities)` or `delete()` method
- in `application.properties` set `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size`
- in `application.properties` set JDBC URL with `rewriteBatchedStatements=true` (optimization for MySQL, statements get rewritten into a single string buffer and sent in a single request)
- in `application.properties` set JDBC URL with `cachePrepStmts=true` (enable caching and is useful if you decide to set `prepStmtCacheSize`, `prepStmtCacheSqlLimit`, etc as well; without this setting the cache is disabled)
- in `application.properties` set JDBC URL with `useServerPrepStmts=true` (this way you switch to server-side prepared statements (may lead to signnificant performance boost))
- before Hibernate 5, we need to set in `application.properties` a setting for enabling batching for versioned entities during update and delete operations (entities that contains `@Version` for implicit optimistic locking); this setting is: `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data=true`; starting with Hibernate 5, this setting should be `true` by default
