**[How To Efficiently Assign A Database Temporary Ranking Of Values To Rows via `RANK()`](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootRankFunction)**
 
**Description:** This application is an example of assigning a database temporary ranking of values to rows via the window function, `RANK()`. This window function is available in almost all databases, and starting with version 8.x is available in MySQL as well.

**Key points:**
- commonly, you don't need to fetch in the result set the temporary ranking of values produced by `RANK()` (you will use it internally, in the query, usually in the `WHERE` clause and CTEs), but, this time, let's write a Spring projection (DTO) that contains a getter for the column generated by `RANK()` as well
- write several native querys relying on `RANK()` window function
