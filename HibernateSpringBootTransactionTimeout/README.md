**[How To Check That Transaction Timeout And Rollback At Expiration Works As Expected](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootTransactionTimeout)**
 
**Note:** Do not test transaction timeout via `Thread.sleep()`! This is not working! Rely on two transactions and exclusive locks or even better rely on SQL sleep functions (e.g., MySQL, `SELECT SLEEP(n)` seconds, PostgreSQL, `SELECT PG_SLEEP(n)` seconds). Most RDBMS supports a sleep function flavor.

**Description:** This application contains several approaches for setting a timeout period for a transaction or query. The timeout is signaled by a specific timeout exception (e.g., `.QueryTimeoutException`). After timeout, the transaction is rolled back. You can see this in the database (visually or query) and on log via a message of type: `Initiating transaction rollback; Rolling back JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(... <open>)]`.

**Key points:**
- set global transaction timeout via `spring.transaction.default-timeout` in seconds (see, `application.properties`)
- set transaction timeout at method-level or class-level via `@Transactional(timeout = n)` in seconds
- set query timeout via JPA `javax.persistence.query.timeout` hint in milliseconds
- set query timeout via Hibrenate `org.hibernate.timeout` hint in seconds
     
**Note:** If you are using `TransactionTemplate` then the timeout can be set via `TransactionTemplate.setTimeout(n)` in seconds.
