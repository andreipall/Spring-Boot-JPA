**[How To Set Up P6Spy in Spring Boot](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootP6spy)**

**Description:** This is a Spring Boot application that uses [P6Spy](https://github.com/p6spy/p6spy). *P6Spy is a framework that enables database data to be seamlessly intercepted and logged with no code changes to the application.*

**Key points:**
- in `pom.xml`, add the P6Spy Maven dependency
- in `application.properties`, set up JDBC URL as, `jdbc:p6spy:mysql://localhost:3306/db_users`
- in `application.properties`, set up driver class name as, `com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver`
- in the application root folder add the file `spy.properties` (this file contains P6Spy configurations); in this application, the logs will be outputed to console, but you can easy switch to a file; more details about P6Spy configurations can be found in documentation
