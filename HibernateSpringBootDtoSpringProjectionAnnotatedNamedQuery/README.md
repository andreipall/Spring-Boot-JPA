**[How To Use JPA Named Queries `@NamedQuery` And Spring Projection (DTO)](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootDtoSpringProjectionAnnotatedNamedQuery)**
 
**Description:** This application is an example of combining JPA named queries `@NamedQuery` and Spring projections (DTO). For queries names we use the `{EntityName}.{RepositoryMethodName}` naming convention. This convention allows us to create in the repository interface methods with the same name as of named query.
  
**Key points:**
- define the named queries
- define the proper Spring projection
