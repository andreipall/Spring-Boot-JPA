**[How `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` Works With `UPDATE`/`INSERT` And `DELETE` Operations](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootPessimisticLocksDelInsUpd)**
 
**Description:** This application is an example of triggering `UPDATE`, `INSERT` and `DELETE` operations in the context of `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` locking against MySQL. While `UPDATE` and `DELETE` are blocked until the exclusive lock is released, `INSERT` depends on the transaction isolation level. Typically, even with exclusive locks, inserts are possible (e.g., in PostgreSQL). In MySQL, for the default isolation level, `REPEATABLE READ`, inserts are prevented against a range of locked entries, but, if we switch to `READ_COMMITTED`, then MySQL acts as PostgreSQL as well.

**Key points:**
- start *Transaction A* and trigger a `SELECT` with `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` to acquire an exclusive lock
- start a concurrent *Transaction B* that triggers an `UPDATE`, `INSERT` or `DELETE` on the rows locked by *Transaction A*
- in case of `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `INSERT` + `REPEATABLE_READ`, *Transaction B* is blocked until it timeouts or *Transaction A* releases the exclusive lock
- in case of `INSERT` + `READ_COMMITTED`, *Transaction B* can insert in the range of rows locked by *Transaction A* even if *Transaction A* is holding an exclusive lock on this range
