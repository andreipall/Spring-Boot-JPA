**[How To Use JPA Named Native Queries `@NamedNativeQuery` And Spring Projection (DTO)](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootDtoSpringProjectionAnnotatedNamedNativeQuery)**
   
**Description:** This application is an example of combining JPA named native queries `@NamedNativeQuery` and Spring projections (DTO). For queries names we use the `{EntityName}.{RepositoryMethodName}` naming convention. This convention allows us to create in the repository interface methods with the same name as of named native query.
 
**Key points:**
- define the named native queries
- define the proper Spring projection
