**[How To Efficiently Distribute The Number Of Rows In The Specified (N) Number Of Groups Via `NTILE(N)`](https://github.com/andreipall/Spring-Boot-JPA/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootNTilleFunction)**
 
**Description:** This application is an example of distributing the number of rows in the specified (N) number of groups via the window function, `NTILE(N)`. This window function is available in almost all databases, and starting with version 8.x is available in MySQL as well.

**Key points:**
- commonly, you don't need to fetch in the result set the temporary ranking of values produced by `NTILE()` (you will use it internally, in the query, usually in the `WHERE` clause and CTEs), but, this time, let's write a Spring projection (DTO) that contains a getter for the column generated by `NTILE()` as well
- write several native querys relying on `NTILE()` window function
